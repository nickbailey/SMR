The usual title, author and date commands given in the preamble
are used to head up the paper, but there's also the smr- varients
which get used in the headers.

If you don't supply them it'll still work, but you'll be warned.

If you supply an smrauthor, you \emph{must} supply an affiliation.

The title is set at the top left of left-hand pages, and the
author above the affiliation at the top right of right-hand pages.
